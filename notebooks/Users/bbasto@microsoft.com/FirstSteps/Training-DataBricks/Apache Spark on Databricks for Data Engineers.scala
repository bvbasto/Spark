// MAGIC # Apache Spark on Databricks for Data Engineers
// MAGIC 
// MAGIC ** Welcome to Databricks! **
// MAGIC 
// MAGIC This notebook intended to give a high level tour of some of the features that are available to users using Apache Spark and Databricks and to be the final step in your process to learn more about how to best use Apache Spark and Databricks together. We'll be walking you through several data sources, creating UDFs, and manipulating data all from the perspective of a data engineer. While this is not by any means exhaustive, by the end of this notebook you should be familiar with a lot of the topics and subjects that are available in Databricks. We'll be reading in some data from several sources including CSVs and raw text files.  
// MAGIC 
// MAGIC First, it's worth defining Databricks. Databricks is a managed platform for running Apache Spark - that means that you do not have to learn complex cluster management concepts nor perform tedious maintenance tasks to take advantage of Apache Spark. Databricks also provides a host of features to help its users be more productive with Spark. It’s a point and click platform for those that prefer a user interface like data scientists or data analysts. This UI is accompanied by a sophisticated API for those that want to automate jobs and aspects of their data workloads. To meet the needs of enterprises, Databricks also includes features such as role-based access control and other intelligent optimizations that not only improve usability for users but also reduce costs and complexity for administrators.
// MAGIC 
// MAGIC It's worth stressing that many tools don't make it easy to prototype easily, then scale up to production workloads easily without heavy work by the operations teams. Databricks greatly simplifies these challenges by making it easy to prototype, schedule, and scale elastically all in the same environment.

// MAGIC ** The Gentle Introduction Series **
// MAGIC 
// MAGIC This notebook is a part of a series of notebooks aimed to get you up to speed with the basics of Spark quickly. This notebook is best suited for those that have very little or no experience with Apache Spark. The series also serves as a strong review for those that have some experience with Spark but aren't as familiar with some of the more sophisticated tools like UDF creation and machine learning pipelines. The other notebooks in this series are:

// MAGIC ## Tutorial Overview
// MAGIC 
// MAGIC In this tutorial, we're going to play around with data source API in Apache Spark. This is going to require us to read and write using a variety of different data sources. We'll hop between different languages and different APIs to show you how to get the most out of Spark as a data engineer.

// COMMAND ----------

// MAGIC %md
// MAGIC ## Reading in our initial dataset
// MAGIC 
// MAGIC For this first section, we're going to be working with a set of Apache log files. These log files are made available by Databricks via the `databricks-datasets` directory. This is made available right at the root directory. We'll get to reading in the data in a minute but accessing this data is a great example of what we can do inside of Databricks. We're going to use some functionality and data that Databricks provides. Firstly, we're going to use the Databricks Filesystem to list all of the [Databricks datasets](https://docs.azuredatabricks.net/user-guide/faq/databricks-datasets.html) that are available for you to use.

// COMMAND ----------

// MAGIC %fs ls dbfs:/databricks-datasets/

// COMMAND ----------

// MAGIC %md Inside of that folder you'll see the sample logs folder.

// COMMAND ----------

// MAGIC %fs ls dbfs:/databricks-datasets/sample_logs

// COMMAND ----------

// MAGIC %python
// MAGIC 
// MAGIC log_files = "/databricks-datasets/sample_logs"

// COMMAND ----------

// MAGIC %md 
// MAGIC You'll see that we have a variety of other example datasets that you can access and play with. While you can simply list and checkout the datasets via the command line or via `%fs ls` it's often easier to just look at [the documentation.](https://docs.azuredatabricks.net/user-guide/faq/databricks-datasets.html)
// MAGIC 
// MAGIC Now that we've touched on Databricks datasets, let's go ahead and get started with the actual log data that we'll be using. This brings us to a unique advantage of Databricks and how easy it is to use multiple languages in the same notebook. For example, a colleague at Databricks had already written an Apache log parser that works quite well in python, rather than writing my own, I'm able to reuse that code very easily by just prefacing my cell with `%python` and copying and pasting the code. Currently this notebook has Scala cells by default as we'll see below.

// COMMAND ----------

// MAGIC %python 
// MAGIC 
// MAGIC import re
// MAGIC from pyspark.sql import Row
// MAGIC APACHE_ACCESS_LOG_PATTERN = '^(\S+) (\S+) (\S+) \[([\w:/]+\s[+\-]\d{4})\] "(\S+) (\S+) (\S+)" (\d{3}) (\d+)'
// MAGIC 
// MAGIC # Returns a dictionary containing the parts of the Apache Access Log.
// MAGIC def parse_apache_log_line(logline):
// MAGIC     match = re.search(APACHE_ACCESS_LOG_PATTERN, logline)
// MAGIC     if match is None:
// MAGIC         # Optionally, you can change this to just ignore if each line of data is not critical.
// MAGIC         # For this example, we want to ensure that the format is consistent.
// MAGIC         raise Exception("Invalid logline: %s" % logline)
// MAGIC     return Row(
// MAGIC         ipAddress    = match.group(1),
// MAGIC         clientIdentd = match.group(2),
// MAGIC         userId       = match.group(3),
// MAGIC         dateTime     = match.group(4),
// MAGIC         method       = match.group(5),
// MAGIC         endpoint     = match.group(6),
// MAGIC         protocol     = match.group(7),
// MAGIC         responseCode = int(match.group(8)),
// MAGIC         contentSize  = long(match.group(9)))

// COMMAND ----------

// MAGIC %md 
// MAGIC Now that I've defined that function, I can use it to convert my unstructured rows of data into something that is a lot more structured (like a table). I'll do that by reading in the log file as an RDD. RDD's (Resilient Distributed Datasets) are the lowest level abstraction made available to users in Databricks. In general, the best tools for users of Apache Spark are DataFrames and Datasets as they provide significant optimizations for many types of operations. However it's worth introducing the concept of an RDD. As the name suggests, these are distributed datasets that are sitting at some location and specify a logical set of steps in order to compute some end result.
// MAGIC 
// MAGIC As we had covered in the first notebook in this series, Spark is lazily evaluated. That means that even though we've specified that we want to read in a piece of data it won't be read in until we perform an action. If you're forgetting these details, please review [the first notebook in this series](https://docs.azuredatabricks.net/_static/notebooks/azure/gentle-introduction-to-apache-spark-azure.html).

// COMMAND ----------

// MAGIC %python
// MAGIC 
// MAGIC log_files = "/databricks-datasets/sample_logs"
// MAGIC raw_log_files = sc.textFile(log_files)

// COMMAND ----------

// MAGIC %md So now that we've specfied what data we would like to read in, let's go and ahead and count the number of rows. Right now we are actually reading in the data however it is not stored in memory. It's just read in, and then discarded. This is because we're calling an **action** which also came up in the first notebook in this series.

// COMMAND ----------

// MAGIC %python 
// MAGIC raw_log_files.count()

// COMMAND ----------

// MAGIC %md This shows us that we've got a total of 100,000 records. But we've still got to parse them. To do that we'll use a map function which will apply that function to each record on the dataset. Now naturally this can happen in a distributed fashion across the cluster. This cluster is made up of executors that will execute computation when they are asked to do so by the primary master node or driver.
// MAGIC 
// MAGIC The diagram below shows an example Spark cluster, basically there exists a Driver node that communicates with executor nodes. Each of these executor nodes have slots which are logically like execution cores. 
// MAGIC 
// MAGIC ![spark-architecture](http://training.databricks.com/databricks_guide/gentle_introduction/videoss_logo.png)
// MAGIC 
// MAGIC The Driver sends Tasks to the empty slots on the Executors when work has to be done:
// MAGIC 
// MAGIC ![spark-architecture](http://training.databricks.com/databricks_guide/gentle_introduction/spark_cluster_tasks.png)
// MAGIC 
// MAGIC Note: *In the case of the Community Edition there is no Worker, and the Master, not shown in the figure, executes the entire code.*
// MAGIC 
// MAGIC ![spark-architecture](https://docs.azuredatabricks.net/_static/images/notebooks/notebook-microcluster-agnostic.png)
// MAGIC 
// MAGIC You can view the details of your Apache Spark application in the Apache Spark web UI.  The web UI is accessible in Databricks by going to "Clusters" and then clicking on the "View Spark UI" link for your cluster, it is also available by clicking at the top left of this notebook where you would select the cluster to attach this notebook to. In this option will be a link to the Apache Spark Web UI.
// MAGIC 
// MAGIC At a high level, every Apache Spark application consists of a driver program that launches various parallel operations on executor Java Virtual Machines (JVMs) running either in a cluster or locally on the same machine. In Databricks, the notebook interface is the driver program.  This driver program contains the main loop for the program and creates distributed datasets on the cluster, then applies operations (transformations & actions) to those datasets.
// MAGIC 
// MAGIC Driver programs access Apache Spark through a `SparkSession` object regardless of deployment location.
// MAGIC 
// MAGIC Let's go ahead and perform a transformation by parsing the log files.

// COMMAND ----------

// MAGIC %python
// MAGIC parsed_log_files = raw_log_files.map(parse_apache_log_line)

// COMMAND ----------

// MAGIC %md
// MAGIC Please note again that no computation has been started, we've only created a logical execution plan that has not been realized yet. In Apache Spark terminology we're specifying a **transformation**. By specifying transformations and not performing them right away, this allows Spark to do a lot of optimizations under the hood most relevantly, pipelining. Pipelining means that Spark will perform as much computation as it can in memory and in one stage as opposed to spilling to disk after each step.
// MAGIC 
// MAGIC Now that we've set up the transformation for parsing this raw text file, we want to make it available in a more structured format. We'll do this by creating a DataFrame (using `toDF()`) and then a table (using `registerTempTable()`). This will give us the added advantage of working with the same dataset in multiple languages.

// COMMAND ----------

// MAGIC %python
// MAGIC parsed_log_files.toDF().registerTempTable("log_data")

// COMMAND ----------

// MAGIC %md `RegisterTempTable` saves the data on the local cluster that we're working with. You won't find it in the `tables` button list on the left because it's not globally registered across all clusters, only this specific one. That means that if we restart, our table will have to be re-registered. Other users and notebooks that attach to this cluster however can access this table. Now let's run some quick SQL to see how our parsing performed. This is an **action**, which specifies that Spark needs to perform some computation in order to return a result to the user.

// COMMAND ----------

// MAGIC %sql select * from log_data limit 5

// COMMAND ----------

// MAGIC %md We're also able to convert it into a Scala DataFrame by just performing a select all.
// MAGIC 
// MAGIC Under the hood, Apache Spark DataFrames and SparkSQL are effectively the same. They operate with the same optimizer and have the same general functions that are made available to them.

// COMMAND ----------

val logData = spark.table("log_data")

// COMMAND ----------

logData.printSchema()

// COMMAND ----------

// MAGIC %md However one thing you've likely noticed is that that DataFrame creation process is still lazy. We have a schema (that was defined during our parsing process) but we haven't kicked off any tasks yet to work with that data.
// MAGIC 
// MAGIC This is actually one of the differences between SparkSQL (using `%sql` in Databricks) and the regular DataFrames API. SparkSQL is a bit more eager with its computations so calls to cache data or select it actually end up being eagerly computed as opposed to lazy. However when we run the code via `sqlContext.sql` it's lazily evaluated. We introduced these concepts in [the Gentle Introduction to Apache Spark and Databricks notebook](https://docs.azuredatabricks.net/_static/notebooks/azure/gentle-introduction-to-apache-spark-azure.html) and it's worth reviewing if this does not seem familiar.
// MAGIC 
// MAGIC Now before moving forward, let's display a bit of the data. Often times you'll want to see a bit of the data that you're working with, we can do this very easily using the `display` function that is available in all languages on a DataFrame or Dataset.

// COMMAND ----------

display(logData.limit(5))

// COMMAND ----------

// MAGIC %md 
// MAGIC As mentioned DataFrames and SparkSQL take advantage of the same optimizations and while we can specify our transformations by using and importing [SparkSQL functions](http://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/scala/index.html#org.apache.spark.sql.functions$), I find it easier just to write the SQL to do my transformations.

// COMMAND ----------

// MAGIC %md 
// MAGIC However, there's one issue here. Our datetime is not in a format that we can parse very easily. Let's go ahead and try to cast it to a timestamp and you'll see what I mean.

// COMMAND ----------

// MAGIC %sql SELECT cast("21/Jun/2014:10:00:00 -0700" as timestamp)

// COMMAND ----------

// MAGIC %md 
// MAGIC 
// MAGIC What we get back is `null` meaning that the operation did not succeed. To convert this date format we're going to have to jump through a couple of hoops, namely we're going to have to handle the fact that [Java Simple Date Format](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/i18n/format/simpleDateFormat.html) (which is what is used in the date time function) does not effectively handle the timezone as specified in our date formatter. Luckily this gives us an awesome way of demonstrating the creation of a UDF!
// MAGIC 
// MAGIC Creating UDFs in Spark and Scala is very simple, you just define a scala function then register it as a UDF. Now this function is a bit involved but the short of it is that we need to convert our string into a timestamp. More specifically we're going to want to define a function that takes in a string, splits on the space character. Converts the hour offset to a form that we can offset our date by and adds it to our newly created datetime.

// COMMAND ----------

def parseDate(rawDate:String):Long = {
  val dtParser = new java.text.SimpleDateFormat("dd/MMM/yyyy:hh:mm:ss")
  val splitted = rawDate.split(" ")
  val futureDt = splitted(0)
  // naturally building the offset is nice and annoying
  // we've got to be sure to extract minutes and 
  // only multiply them by 60 as opposed to the 60^2
  // required for hours
  val offset = splitted(1).asInstanceOf[String].toLong
  val hourOffset = (offset.toInt / 100) 
  val minuteOffset = (offset - hourOffset * 100).toInt
  val totalOffset = hourOffset * 60 * 60 + minuteOffset * 60
  // now the time that we get here is in milliseconds
  // so we've got to divide by 1000 then add our offset.
  // SparkSQL also works at the second level when casting long types to
  // timestamp Types, so we've got to ensure that we are using seconds
  (dtParser.parse(futureDt).getTime() / 1000) + totalOffset
}

val example = "21/Jun/2014:10:00:00 -0730"
parseDate(example)

// COMMAND ----------

// MAGIC %md Now there are two different ways to register a UDF and we'll do both of them just to be clear about how to do it. The first is by using the `udf` function from `org.apache.spark.sql.functions`. This will allow you to use it on DataFrame columns.

// COMMAND ----------

import org.apache.spark.sql.functions.udf
val parseDateUdf = udf(parseDate(_:String):Long)

// COMMAND ----------

display(logData.select(parseDateUdf($"dateTime")).limit(5))

// COMMAND ----------

// MAGIC %md The other way is to register it with the `sqlContext`. This will allow you to use it inside of plain SQL as opposed to operating on a DataFrame column.

// COMMAND ----------

sqlContext.udf.register("parseDate", parseDate(_:String):Long)

// COMMAND ----------

val cleanLogFiles = spark.sql("""
SELECT 
  clientIdentd, int(contentSize) as contentSize, cast(parseDate(dateTime) as timestamp) as dt, 
  endpoint, ipAddress, method, protocol, int(responseCode) as responseCode, userId 
FROM log_data
""")

// COMMAND ----------

// MAGIC %md Another way of performing the above computation is by using the `selectExpr` method with allows you to use SQL expressions on a DataFrame.

// COMMAND ----------

val cleanLogFiles = logData.selectExpr("clientIdentd"," int(contentSize) as contentSize"," cast(parseDate(dateTime) as timestamp) as dt","endpoint"," ipAddress"," method"," protocol"," int(responseCode) as responseCode"," userId")

// COMMAND ----------

display(cleanLogFiles.limit(5))

// COMMAND ----------

// MAGIC %md What's great about this is now we've got this UDF and we can reuse it in a variety of different languages (if we register it with the `sqlContext`). Now that we've created the plan for how to create this DataFrame - let's go ahead and run the `explain` method. This will give us the entire logical (and physical) instructions for Apache Spark to recalculate that DataFrame. Notice that this goes down to the raw RDD (and text file!) that we created in Python at the top of the notebook!

// COMMAND ----------

cleanLogFiles.explain

// COMMAND ----------

// MAGIC %md Now we can delete the folder.

// COMMAND ----------

dbutils.fs.rm("/mnt/dst-bucket/data-backup", true)

// COMMAND ----------

// MAGIC %md Now finally we can write out our data!

// COMMAND ----------

archiveReady.write.parquet("/mnt/dst-bucket/data-backup/")

// COMMAND ----------
